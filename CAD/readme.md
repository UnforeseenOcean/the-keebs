# CAD files (STEP, DXF, DWG) for the designs

If you've received a free or "pay only the switches and shipping" kit from me and the acrylic back panel came damaged or if you broke it, you will be able to manfacture a new one using thse files.

The content will be added as the designs are finalized.
