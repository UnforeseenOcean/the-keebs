My questionable keyboard designs

## Wait, why are some folders empty?
Well, I need to at least make sure they're ready to be released, so it won't have things like this:

## What is this repository for?
This is to store my keyboard designs, however bad or good it is. 

I guess you can enjoy... looking at them? I suppose? Or I guess you can get them manufactured, if it fancies you, or if it looks interesting.

Most of the designs are *in theory* electrically sound and should work, but I cannot guarantee anything.

Oh, also the CAD folder will include the STEP file (if applicable) and the backplate drawing in DWG and DXF format, which are two most supported formats in most laser cutter software products.
