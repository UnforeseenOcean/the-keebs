# The Keebs
My questionable keyboard designs

# Project has been retired
Hello all, I hope you're well. I've been thinking about this for a while, and I finally decided.

Due to a lack of demand and interest, the design projects will be put on indefinite hiatus, with all project files released as-is. I am hoping I can do better in the future and I will be reevaluating if this hobby is really for me. The designs I made were for the people, so they can learn from my mistakes and see what steps I took to achieve certain goals. If nobody is interested in it, then it has no purpose in my eyes, and I've lost all motivation to work on them. This was not a decision I made on a whim.
If you were interested in the future designs, I am so sorry to disappoint you. This is for my mental health, and I hope you understand.

## Wait, why are some folders empty?
Well, I need to at least make sure they're ready to be released, so it won't have things like this:

## What is this repository for?
This is to store my keyboard designs, however bad or good it is. 

I guess you can enjoy... looking at them? I suppose? Or I guess you can get them manufactured, if it fancies you, or if it looks interesting.

Most of the designs are *in theory* electrically sound and should work, but I cannot guarantee anything.

Oh, also the CAD folder will include the STEP file (if applicable) and the backplate drawing in DWG and DXF format, which are two most supported formats in most laser cutter software products.
