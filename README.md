# The Keebs
My questionable keyboard designs

# Project has been retired
Hello all, I hope you're well. I've been thinking about this for a while, and I finally decided.

Due to a lack of demand and interest, the design projects will be put on indefinite hiatus, with all project files released as-is. I am hoping I can do better in the future and I will be reevaluating if this hobby is really for me. The designs I made were for the people, so they can learn from my mistakes and see what steps I took to achieve certain goals. If nobody is interested in it, then it has no purpose in my eyes, and I've lost all motivation to work on them. This was not a decision I made on a whim.
If you were interested in the future designs, I am so sorry to disappoint you. This is for my mental health, and I hope you understand.

# Letter from the author

Hello all, as you can see from above, this project has been retired. I cannot say for certain if there ever will be new designs I will share with people around the world in the future, and if I will continue my hobby.
I thought I'd drop by to explain the purpose of my designs. The designs included in this repository are my works, and they are provided free of charge so people can learn from it. It contains both good and bad practices. I'm sorry I didn't include the detailed explanation for the designs as I originally promised, and I hope you can just see my design as an example. Not an example to follow as a good practice or to be torn apart as a bad example, just a design someone, somewhere in the world made some day in history.

I understand that my designs are not attractive. They're not anything unique. It's been done to death, to be painfully honest. I can think of at least 4 different much more interesting and useful designs you could use instead of my designs. For example, Alice or (insert word here)65. While I believe that some good could come out of this room-temperature water of a design, I also believe that if you want to make *interesting* designs, this is not the base you should use. Please look for better examples if you are in that category. These designs, apart from maybe one, are not interesting. Moreover, apart from Luna, I could not make the rest of the designs work. They're bad.

But, Luna is different. I've built it so it will work. It's a very simple keyboard that is full-size, with no frills. No bells and whistles either. It's a thing that works. While you really should be looking for something else if you want:
- Beautiful keyboard (Such as Edda)
- Interesting keyboard (foone's Physics Keyboard, for example)
You could use Luna for something.

Let me tell you the story behind Luna. I've been having insomnia, as well as whatever waking up too early is called. I've been depressed, I've been s uicidal. Luna was a cat. While she was a street cat who would've already forgotten me by now, she gave me hope to continue. Then I was introduced to the world of custom keyboards. I was amazed at what people can do with just some diodes, switches and some chips, and I wanted to try it myself. I've named the "early wake-up ghost" Luna (since I couldn't find her anymore), and I decided to name the first ever keyboard with her name, with hope that someone, somewhere will remember my design. Just like the tabby who loved humans.

Now you might be saying, "Hey, you said your design is so forgettable it might've been better off not existing, but then you give me this sob story about how you named the first keyboard? Which is it, do you want people to remember your stuff or not?" and you would be completely correct for asking; To be honest, I don't care about any other designs. I just wish that, at least Luna is remembered. I tried my best with it, and it was a catalyst that brought me to where I am right now. Even if I decide not to pursue this hobby anymore, I learned a lot making it. And I hope you do too. Sorry if my letter was confusing to read, but I really wanted to say what went behind the scenes.

Take care,
From Toby

## Wait, why are some folders empty?
Well, I need to at least make sure they're ready to be released, so it won't have things like this:

## What is this repository for?
This is to store my keyboard designs, however bad or good it is. 

I guess you can enjoy... looking at them? I suppose? Or I guess you can get them manufactured, if it fancies you, or if it looks interesting.

Most of the designs are *in theory* electrically sound and should work, but I cannot guarantee anything.

Oh, also the CAD folder will include the STEP file (if applicable) and the backplate drawing in DWG and DXF format, which are two most supported formats in most laser cutter software products.
